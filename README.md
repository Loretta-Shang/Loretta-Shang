## 💼 Internships  
I've interned at some awesome companies where I shipped real stuff:

- 🧾 **Rippling** — Payroll team, full-stack engineering building real features at real scale ⚙️💰

- ☁️ ...and more! From client-facing projects to cloud infrastructure 🚀  

## 🛠️ Experience  
- 🧪 Research in LLM safety — curated and benchmarked datasets 🔬🤖  
- 🧠 **ICPC & Competitive Programming** — regional medalist, Codeforces addict 🧩💥  
- 💡 Hackathons — I build fast, break less, and occasionally win things 🥇🚀  

## 🌱 Interests  
I love building things that *work efficiently*:

- 🔗 **Distributed infrastructure**  
- 🚀 **Database internals**  
- 🧠 **Low-latency computing**  
- 🧙 Systems design, backend engineering, and everything in between!

📚 Outside of coding:
- I'm probably reading novels 📖, exploring random CS papers 📄, or planning my next hair color 💇‍♀️🎨

🌱 Always learning. Always curious. Always caffeinated ☕️💡
